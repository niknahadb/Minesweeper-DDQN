I am training an agent to play Minesweeper on expert difficulty using a DDQN

My goal is to use reinforcement learning and Q-learning to do so

Create an agent-agnostic environment that returns state and reward in response to agent's decisions

Relevant Python files:

**minesweeper** set up Minesweeper GUI

**train_minesweeper** sets up the environment for the agent

**DDQN** functions required by agent

**play_minesweeper** option to view GUI or benchmark the agent's performance. imports a saved neural network model and uses it to play Minesweeper.
